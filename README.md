# Movie-memE
The idea of this project is to create a tool that is able to automatically generate a gif animation from a movie based on my mood/status.

BATCH GIF GENERATION 
This script generates a (large) set of animations from a movie given the dialogue timings specified on a subtitle file. The result is a GIF file for each dialogue in the movie!
Example: python batch_generator.py ~/matrix.srt ~/matrix.mp4 ./
